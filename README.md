# LCD-Menu-Macro
This Macro allows the ability to make a branching menu on a 2x16 LCD with a variety of options.

Tutorial is provided in the code on how to initialize the 16 parameters. This macro allows the user to call a function depending on where the cursor is positioned. The function called can either be some random function, or it could be the initialization of another call to the macro. This creates a deep network of menu levels that is infinite. Each menu has the option of having 1,2,3, or 4 selections to choose from. 

NOTE: THIS MACRO REQUIRES USAGE OF THE SET OF MACROS "LCD_4bit.inc" which was not created by me.
